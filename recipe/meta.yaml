  summary: The basic idea of latent semantic analysis (LSA) is,  that text do have a higher order (=latent semantic) structure which,  however, is obscured by word usage (e.g. through the use of synonyms  or polysemy). By using conceptual indices that are derived statistically  via a truncated singular value decomposition
    (a two-mode factor analysis)  over a given document-term matrix, this variability problem can be overcome.
